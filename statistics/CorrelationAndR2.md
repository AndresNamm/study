# RESEARCH ABOUT CORRELATION 

+ Covariance is essentially a sum of replications between deviations from X and Y which we divide by (n-1) to get the average of deviation multiplications.
+ To get the correlation from it, we get the standard deviations of both datasets and replicate these standard deviations of X and Y with each other. This gives us a baseline for what the maximum Covariance could be. 
+ In Covariance You can think of each part of the summation as an individual Standard Deviation replication pairwise that can also have a negative value. 
+ My question is still, how we can get the Covariance to be the same as replication of STDs with perfect correlationa

+ The to and bottom of this function in case of high correlation should be equalt to each other. In the bottom we are taking the sum of deviations squared and then taking the sqrt from it.
