  + Between [0..1]
  + Tells us about how much (how many percentages) the variation in Y depends on (regression from) X. 
  + Is a good indicator on how well the regression line can predict the data.

  + the optimizartion is convex because wights are linear. They can only add or take away from total weight. +-
