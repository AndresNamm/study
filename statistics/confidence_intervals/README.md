I have provided some references and short explanations but in general I really recommend you to google your own tutorials that fit the best for the way you understand things.

# CLT

The proof for central limit theorem is very theoretical and we wont cover it here but the result of CLT is that
taking n samples with Size N point estimates will have a normal distribution with characteristics shown on the below image. [Refernce to a good explanation](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/BS704_Probability/BS704_Probability12.html#:~:text=The%20central%20limit%20theorem%20states,will%20be%20approximately%20normally%20distributed.)

# Confidence Interval

With a confidence interval we have a lower bound L and upper bound U and we claim that we are X percent sure that the global estimate lies in this bound. [look at the example here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/confidence-interval.html)
