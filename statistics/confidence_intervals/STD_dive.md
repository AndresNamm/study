# STD of dataset vs STD over multiple samples


## EXAMPLE 

Lets say we have a binomial distribution. We can calculate its STD for 2 scenarios 

1. How much each individual sample is expected to vary in (individual sample level)
2. How much the mean of X samples with size N is expected to vary (over multiple samples)

It is important to understand the difference here.  

1. Is important to understand the possibilities for the individual changes in dataset from its specific mean. 
2. Is important to understand how much the means of different samples can vary over multiple samples. This is important for calculating the confidence interval
for how much the mean (or maybe something else)  can vary.
