1. by deducting mean from X we are centralizing the distribution to 0. Previously the mean was $` \mu `$ but if we take $` \mu `$ away from all the elements then the average will go to 0 
2. by dividing everything difference with $` \sigma `$ we will be dividing the average deviance from mean with the average deviance from the mean. This means the average deviance from mean will become in the end as 1.
