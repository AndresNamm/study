# COMMENTS ON DOING POWER ANALYSIS ON HYPOTHESIS TESTING - CALCULATING EFFECT

For me the effect part became a bit complicated here. In general it was recommended to use this formula to get effect:

However as Power Analysis is done before conducting the test, calculating the effect based on this formula is not super obvious. There is a chance to use ofcourse data from previous research. Another thing that was recommended is to use some known meanigful effect in the field from some domain knowledge. This seems to make more sense because the aim of Power Analysis is to conduct your experiment so that you will not make type 2 error. If you overestimate your effect in the Power Analysis you will get smaller sample size which means you might **get a type 2 error in your Actual Test**
