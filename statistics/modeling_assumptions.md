# INDEPENDENCE OF SAMPLES 


Maybe good way to understand is to bring an examples: 
    + Dependent: A training program assessment takes pretest and posttest scores from the same group of people.
    + Independent: Taking a random sample from each of the two groups under study. For example to compare heights of males and females, we could take a random sample of 100 females and another random sample of 100 males. The result would be two samples which are independent of each other.
    + Independent: Taking a random sample from the entire population and then dividing it into two sub-samples based upon the grouping variable of interest. For example, we take a random sample of U.S. adults and then split them into two samples based upon gender. This results in a sub-sample of females and a sub-sample of males which are independent of each other.
