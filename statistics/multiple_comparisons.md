In this example we have a dataset where we actually know what the correct t-test would produce. In real life this would not happen but lets assume this happens for us. 
In this example we know that 900 cases the H0 is true and for 100 cases H1 is true. 
+ If we know the H0 is true in 900 cases and know the alpha is 0.05 we know that in 5 % of the cases we would have this situation
